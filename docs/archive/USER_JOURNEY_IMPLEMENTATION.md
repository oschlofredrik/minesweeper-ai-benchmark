   session = SessionConfig(
       format=CompetitionFormat.MULTI_ROUND,
       rounds=[...],  # Per-round configuration
       flow_mode=FlowMode.SYNCHRONOUS
   )
   ```

2. **Live Control Panel**:
   - Real-time evaluation queue monitoring
   - Player progress tracking
   - Intervention tools (extend time, skip)
   - Commentary mode for highlights

3. **Between-Round Features**:
   - Showcase top prompts
   - AI explanation of strategies
   - Voting periods
   - Dynamic difficulty adjustment

### PLAYER Journey Enhancements

1. **Enhanced Lobby Experience**:
   ```python
   # Rich practice options while waiting
   activities = lobby.get_available_activities(player_id)
   # Includes: tutorials, free play, prompt lab, challenges
   ```

2. **Prompt Writing Experience**:
   ```python
   # Intelligent assistance
   suggestions = prompt_assistant.suggest_completion(
       partial_prompt, game_context, cursor_position
   )
   
   # Quality feedback
   analysis = prompt_assistant.analyze_prompt_quality(
       prompt, game_name
   )
   ```

3. **Waiting Phase Engagement**:
   - Watch AI execute their prompt
   - See preliminary scores
   - Complete mini-activities
   - Earn engagement points

4. **Results & Learning**:
   - Detailed score breakdowns
   - Compare with top prompts
   - Save successful prompts
   - Performance analytics

### SPECTATOR Journey (Foundation)

While not fully implemented, the event system supports:
- Real-time updates via WebSocket
- Multiple view perspectives
- Prediction games
- Clip creation moments

## Handling Key Challenges

### 1. Asynchronous Delays

**Problem**: AI evaluation takes 2-30 seconds vs instant quiz answers.

**Solution**:
- Engagement activities during wait
- Progress visualization
- Flexible flow modes
- Time banking system

### 2. Prompt Complexity

**Problem**: Writing prompts is harder than selecting answers.

**Solution**:
- Progressive template system
- Real-time assistance
- Quality analysis
- Practice modes

### 3. Learning Curve

**Problem**: Prompt engineering has a high barrier to entry.

**Solution**:
- Interactive tutorials
- Guided templates
- Strategy guides
- Achievement progression

### 4. Fairness Perception

**Problem**: AI evaluation may seem inconsistent.

**Solution**:
- Transparent scoring
- Detailed breakdowns
- Multiple evaluation runs
- Clear rubrics

## Integration Example

```python
# Complete flow from lobby to competition
async def competition_flow():
    # 1. Create lobby with session
    lobby = CompetitionLobby(session_config)
    
    # 2. Players join and practice
    await lobby.add_player(player_id, player_name)
    await lobby.start_practice_activity(player_id, "tutorial_minesweeper")
    
    # 3. Players ready up
    await lobby.set_player_ready(player_id, True)
    
    # 4. Competition starts
    flow_manager = AsyncGameFlowManager(
        evaluation_engine,
        flow_mode=FlowMode.SYNCHRONOUS
    )
    
    # 5. Handle rounds with engagement
    await flow_manager.start_round(1, player_ids)
    
    # 6. Submit prompts with assistance
    result = await flow_manager.submit_prompt(
        player_id, round_number, prompt, game_config
    )
    
    # 7. Engage during wait
    await flow_manager.record_engagement(
        player_id, round_number, "watch_replay", {...}
    )
```

## Next Implementation Steps

1. **WebSocket Integration**: Real-time updates for all events
2. **Frontend Components**: React/Vue components for each journey phase
3. **Mobile Optimization**: Touch-friendly prompt writing
4. **Advanced Analytics**: Performance tracking and insights
5. **Tournament Modes**: Bracket and league systems

## Success Metrics

- **Engagement**: Players stay active during AI evaluation (target: 80%+)
- **Completion**: Sessions finish successfully (target: 90%+)
- **Learning**: Prompt quality improves over time (measurable via scoring)
- **Retention**: Players return for multiple sessions (target: 60%+)
- **Accessibility**: New players succeed without frustration (target: 70%+ tutorial completion)

## Conclusion

The implementation successfully addresses the core challenges of adapting Kahoot's instant-feedback model to AI-evaluated prompts. The asynchronous flow system keeps players engaged during waits, the template system makes prompt writing accessible, and the lobby provides rich practice opportunities. Together, these components create an engaging, educational platform for learning prompt engineering through competition.
