# Recent Updates - Minesweeper AI Benchmark

## July 2025 Updates

### Database Administration Interface

We've added a comprehensive database management interface accessible through the Admin panel. This allows for complete control over games and leaderboard data.

#### Features:
- **Database Statistics**: Real-time overview of games, models, and performance
- **Game Management**: 
  - Filter games by model, provider, or win status
  - View individual game details including transcripts
  - Delete specific games or bulk delete by criteria
- **Leaderboard Management**:
  - View all leaderboard entries with detailed metrics
  - Reset model statistics (deletes all games for fresh start)
  - Delete leaderboard entries (keeps game data)

#### Database Migration:
If you have an existing deployment, run the migration script to add new columns:
```bash
python scripts/migrate_db_add_columns.py
```

This adds:
- `games.full_transcript` - Complete game transcript including reasoning
- `games.task_id` - Reference to the benchmark task
- `games.job_id` - Reference to the play session
- `leaderboard_entries.created_at` - Timestamp for entry creation

### UI/UX Improvements

#### Consistent Dieter Rams Design:
- **Admin Access**: Text-only "Admin" button in left sidebar (no icon)
- **Live Game Stream**: Removed all colored elements
  - Emoji replaced with text indicators (GAME, WIN, ERROR, etc.)
  - No colored backgrounds, only subtle borders
  - Consistent monochrome aesthetic
- **Leaderboard Tooltips**: Hover over metrics for explanations
- **Favicon**: Minimalist Minesweeper grid design

### Error Handling & Fair Scoring

#### Technical Failure Handling:
We now distinguish between game losses and technical failures:

- **GameStatus.ERROR**: New status for API errors, timeouts, and system failures
- **Fair Scoring**: Technical failures don't count as losses in win rate
- **Error Tracking**: Full error messages stored with game transcripts
- **Leaderboard Accuracy**: Only valid games (WON/LOST) count toward rankings

#### How It Works:
```python
# Before: API error → Game incomplete → Counts as loss → 0% win rate
# After:  API error → Game marked ERROR → Excluded from stats → Fair scoring
```

### Model-Specific Fixes

#### OpenAI o1 Models:
- Fixed "system message not supported" error
- System prompts now combined with user messages for o1-preview/o1-mini

#### OpenAI o3/o4 Models:
- Proper timeout configurations (2-5 minutes)
- Uses new responses API endpoint
- Special handling for reasoning output

#### Message Format Adaptation:
```python
# Automatically adapts based on model capabilities
if model.supports_system_messages:
    messages = [{"role": "system", ...}, {"role": "user", ...}]
else:
    # Combine for models like o1
    messages = [{"role": "user", "content": system + user}]
```

### Admin Panel Features

Access all admin features through the left sidebar button:

1. **Prompts Tab**: Create and manage prompt templates
2. **Models Tab**: Configure model settings and API keys
3. **Settings Tab**: System-wide configuration options
4. **Features Tab**: Toggle feature flags
5. **Database Tab**: Complete database management (NEW)
6. **Export/Import Tab**: Backup and restore configuration

### Safe Database Operations

If database columns are missing, the platform handles it gracefully:
- Safe SQL endpoints check for column existence
- Fallback to available columns until migration is run
- Clear error messages guide you to run migration

### Debugging Enhancements

#### Comprehensive Logging:
- Detailed logs for all database operations
- API request/response logging with timing
- Error tracking with full stack traces
- Game state transitions logged

#### Example Log Output:
```
[INFO] Database stats endpoint called
[INFO] Got database connection
[INFO] Database stats retrieved successfully: 42 games, 5 leaderboard entries
```

### API Endpoints

New database admin endpoints:
- `GET /api/admin/db/stats` - Database statistics
- `GET /api/admin/db/games` - List games with filters
- `DELETE /api/admin/db/games/{game_id}` - Delete specific game
- `GET /api/admin/db/leaderboard` - Leaderboard management view
- `POST /api/admin/db/cleanup` - Bulk cleanup operations

Safe endpoints (work without migration):
- `GET /api/admin/db/safe/stats` - Safe statistics
- `GET /api/admin/db/safe/games` - Safe game listing

## Summary

These updates focus on:
1. **Fairness**: Technical failures don't penalize models
2. **Management**: Complete database control through admin panel
3. **Design**: Consistent Dieter Rams aesthetic throughout
4. **Reliability**: Robust error handling and logging
5. **Compatibility**: All model types properly supported

The platform now provides accurate benchmarking with comprehensive administrative tools, ensuring fair evaluation of AI models on the Minesweeper reasoning task.
