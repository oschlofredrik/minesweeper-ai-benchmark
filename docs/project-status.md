- Anthropic integration (Claude 3 family)
- Robust action parsing from various response formats
- Automatic reasoning extraction
- Multiple prompt formats (standard, JSON, chain-of-thought)

### 3. **Evaluation System**
- Comprehensive metrics calculation
  - Win rate, valid move rate
  - Mine identification precision/recall
  - Board coverage analysis
  - Move efficiency tracking
- Async game runner with parallel execution
- Detailed game transcripts
- Result persistence

### 4. **Task System**
- Task generator for creating benchmark scenarios
- Support for interactive (full game) and static (single move) tasks
- Difficulty levels (beginner, intermediate, expert)
- Task repository for storage and retrieval
- Reproducible task generation with seeds

### 5. **Command-Line Interface**
- Full-featured CLI with Rich UI
- Commands for:
  - Model evaluation
  - Model comparison
  - Task generation
  - Results viewing
  - Interactive gameplay
- Progress tracking and detailed output
- JSON export for all results

## üìä Current Capabilities

The platform can now:
- ‚úÖ Evaluate any OpenAI or Anthropic model on Minesweeper
- ‚úÖ Run parallel evaluations for faster benchmarking
- ‚úÖ Calculate comprehensive performance metrics
- ‚úÖ Compare multiple models on identical tasks
- ‚úÖ Generate reproducible benchmark datasets
- ‚úÖ Export results for analysis
- ‚úÖ Support different prompting strategies

## üöÄ Ready for Use

To start using the platform:

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Set up API keys** in `.env`:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-key
   ```

3. **Generate tasks**:
   ```bash
   python -m src.cli.main generate-tasks --num-tasks 50
   ```

4. **Run evaluation**:
   ```bash
   python -m src.cli.main evaluate --model gpt-4 --num-games 10
   ```

## üìà Example Results

Based on the implementation, models will be evaluated on:
- **Logic and deduction**: Can the model identify safe moves?
- **Strategic planning**: Does it clear the board efficiently?
- **Error recovery**: How does it handle ambiguous situations?
- **Reasoning quality**: Are explanations logical and correct?

## üîÑ Future Enhancements

While the core platform is complete, potential additions include:

### Web Interface & Leaderboard
- Public leaderboard for model rankings
- Game replay visualization
- Interactive result exploration

### Extended Features
- Local model support (HuggingFace)
