# Comprehensive AI Model Benchmark Analysis Report

Generated: 2025-07-28

## Executive Summary

This report analyzes the performance of AI models on the Tilts benchmark platform, which evaluates Large Language Models (LLMs) on logic-based reasoning tasks through games like Minesweeper and Risk. The analysis covers both local file results and database records.

## Key Findings

### 1. **Limited Data Available**

The current benchmark data shows significant technical issues:
- **44 total games attempted** (all in Minesweeper)
- **0 games completed successfully** - all games show "in_progress" status with 0 moves
- **2 models tested**: GPT-4 and GPT-4-Turbo-Preview
- **No Risk game data** found in results

### 2. **Model Performance Comparison**

Based on available data:

| Model | Games Attempted | Avg Response Time | Status |
|-------|----------------|-------------------|---------|
| GPT-4 | 42 | 0.28s | All incomplete |
| GPT-4-Turbo-Preview | 2 | 0.76s | All incomplete |

### 3. **Database Leaderboard Data**

The Supabase database contains placeholder leaderboard entries showing expected performance levels:

| Model | Win Rate | MS-S Score | MS-I Score |
|-------|----------|------------|------------|
| GPT-4 | 85.0% | 0.000 | 0.000 |
| Claude-3-Opus | 82.0% | 0.000 | 0.000 |

*Note: These appear to be demo/placeholder values as no actual games are recorded in the database.*

## Technical Issues Identified

### 1. **Game Execution Problems**
- All 44 games failed to execute any moves
- Games remain in "in_progress" status indefinitely
- Average duration of 0.28-0.76 seconds suggests immediate failure

### 2. **Possible Causes**
Based on the CLAUDE.md documentation, recent updates implemented function calling to improve reliability:
- OpenAI function calling for structured responses
- Anthropic tool use for reliable move formatting
- These features may not have been active during the test runs

### 3. **Data Quality Concerns**
- No completed games means no meaningful performance metrics
- Cannot assess:
  - Win rates
  - Move validity
  - Board coverage
  - Mine identification accuracy
  - Strategic reasoning quality

## Recommendations

### 1. **Immediate Actions**
1. **Verify Environment Setup**
   - Ensure all API keys are correctly configured
   - Check that function calling is enabled for both OpenAI and Anthropic models
   - Verify network connectivity and API access

2. **Re-run Evaluations**
   ```bash
   # Generate fresh tasks
   python -m src.cli.main generate-tasks --num-tasks 50
   
   # Run evaluation with proper configuration
   python -m src.cli.main evaluate --model gpt-4 --num-games 10
   python -m src.cli.main evaluate --model claude-3-opus --num-games 10
   ```

3. **Test Risk Game Implementation**
   - The platform supports Risk but no Risk games were found in the data
   - Test with: `python -m src.cli.main evaluate --model gpt-4 --game risk --num-games 5`

### 2. **Performance Testing Strategy**

Once technical issues are resolved, focus on:

1. **Minesweeper Performance Metrics**
   - Win rate on different difficulty levels
   - Valid move percentage
   - Mine flagging accuracy
   - Board exploration efficiency

2. **Risk Game Performance**
   - Strategic planning capabilities
   - Territory management
   - Combat decision making
   - Long-term vs short-term trade-offs

3. **Cross-Game Comparison**
   - Which models excel at spatial reasoning (Minesweeper)?
   - Which models show better strategic planning (Risk)?
   - How does performance correlate across game types?

### 3. **Expected Performance Patterns**

Based on the platform design and LLM capabilities:

**For Minesweeper:**
- GPT-4 models should excel at logical deduction
- Claude models may show better pattern recognition
- Expect 60-80% win rates on beginner/intermediate levels
- Expert level (30x16, 99 mines) will be challenging for all models

**For Risk:**
- Models with better long-term planning should outperform
- Turn-based strategy requires different skills than Minesweeper
- Expect high variance due to dice-based combat

## Conclusion

The current benchmark data indicates technical issues prevented proper evaluation of AI models. The platform itself appears well-designed with:
- Robust game implementations
- Comprehensive metric tracking
- Support for multiple game types
- Advanced features like function calling for reliable AI interaction

Once technical issues are resolved, this platform should provide valuable insights into:
- LLM reasoning capabilities across different game types
- Comparative strengths of different model architectures
- Areas where current AI models excel or struggle

The combination of Minesweeper (spatial/logical reasoning) and Risk (strategic planning) provides a diverse benchmark for evaluating AI decision-making capabilities.

## Next Steps

1. Debug and fix the game execution pipeline
2. Re-run comprehensive evaluations with 50+ games per model
3. Include both Minesweeper and Risk in the benchmark
4. Test additional models (Claude-3-Sonnet, GPT-4-Turbo, etc.)
5. Analyze performance patterns across game types
6. Publish results to the leaderboard for community comparison
