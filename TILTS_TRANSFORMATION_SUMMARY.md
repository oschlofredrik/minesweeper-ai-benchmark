# Tilts Platform Transformation Summary

## Overview
Successfully transformed the Minesweeper AI Benchmark into a flexible, game-agnostic Kahoot-style AI competition platform called "Tilts".

## Completed Transformations

### 1. Core Architecture
- **Game Plugin System** (`src/games/base.py`)
  - Created `BaseGame` abstract class for game implementations
  - Defined `GameInstance`, `GameState`, and `GameAction` interfaces
  - Extracted Minesweeper logic into a plugin
  - Implemented example Sudoku and Number Puzzle plugins

### 2. Flexible Scoring Framework (`src/scoring/framework.py`)
- **Composable scoring components** with configurable weights
- **Standard scoring profiles** (Speed Demon, Perfectionist, Strategist, etc.)
- **Custom profile creation** support
- **Per-game and per-round scoring** configurations

### 3. Database Schema Updates
- **Migration script** (`alembic/versions/add_multi_game_support.py`)
- **9 new tables** for multi-game support:
  - `games_registry` - Central game registry
  - `competition_sessions` - Multi-round competitions
  - `session_rounds` - Individual round configurations
  - `prompt_library` - Saved prompts with versioning
  - `scoring_profiles` - Reusable scoring configurations
  - And more...
- **Updated existing tables** to support multiple games

### 4. Competition System
- **Session Management** (`src/competition/session.py`)
  - Multi-round competitions with different games
  - Flexible formats (single round, best-of-N, tournament)
  - Join codes for easy access

- **Asynchronous Game Flow** (`src/competition/async_flow.py`)
  - Handles AI evaluation delays gracefully
  - Player states: WAITING → WRITING → SUBMITTED → EVALUATING → COMPLETED
  - Engagement activities during wait times

- **Lobby System** (`src/competition/lobby.py`)
  - Rich pre-game experience with 5 practice modes
  - Team formation and chat
  - Warm-up activities

### 5. Real-time Features
- **Evaluation Queue** (`src/competition/realtime_queue.py`)
  - Priority-based queue management
  - Worker pool for parallel processing
  - Real-time progress updates via WebSocket

- **Spectator Mode** (`src/competition/spectator_mode.py`)
  - 6 viewing modes (Overview, Focus, Split, etc.)
  - Prediction games and engagement features
  - Commentary system

### 6. Prompt Management
- **Template System** (`src/prompts/template_system.py`)
  - Multi-level templates (BEGINNER to EXPERT)
  - Intelligent auto-completion
  - Quality analysis and suggestions

- **Prompt Library** (`src/prompts/library.py`)
  - Version control for prompts
  - Sharing and collaboration features
  - Performance tracking

### 7. API Endpoints (Game-Agnostic)
- **Game Management** (`src/api/game_endpoints.py`)
  - `/api/games/` - List available games
  - `/api/games/{game_name}/play` - Start game instances
  - `/api/games/{game_name}/leaderboard` - Game-specific rankings

- **Session Management** (`src/api/session_endpoints.py`)
  - `/api/sessions/create` - Create competitions
  - `/api/sessions/join` - Join with code
  - `/api/sessions/{id}/ws` - WebSocket for real-time updates

- **Prompt Features** (`src/api/prompt_endpoints.py`)
  - `/api/prompts/save` - Save prompts
  - `/api/prompts/search` - Find prompts
  - `/api/prompts/{id}/fork` - Fork and modify

### 8. Between-Round Features
- **Showcase System** (`src/competition/showcase.py`)
  - 6 showcase types (Best Move, Strategy Spotlight, etc.)
  - Voting and learning opportunities
  - Community engagement

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Plugin Architecture**: Games are completely decoupled from the platform
2. **Flexible Scoring**: Any combination of metrics can be weighted
3. **Async-First**: Designed for AI evaluation delays from the ground up
4. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket integration for live experiences
5. **Progressive Enhancement**: Works without JavaScript, better with it

## Migration Path

1. Run database migration: `python scripts/migrate_to_multi_game.py`
2. Update configuration files for new game plugins
3. Deploy with updated API endpoints
4. Frontend updates to support game selection (pending)

## Remaining Tasks (Low Priority)

1. Update frontend to support dynamic game rendering
2. Build player profile and progression system
3. Design mobile-optimized prompt writing experience
4. Create comprehensive tutorial and onboarding system

## Technical Notes

- All existing Minesweeper functionality preserved
- Backward compatibility maintained
- New features are opt-in via configuration
- Platform ready for additional game plugins

## Testing

Basic endpoint testing available:
```bash
python test_new_endpoints.py
```

Full integration testing recommended after database migration.

## Deployment Considerations

- New environment variables for multi-game features
- Database migration required before first use
- WebSocket support needed for real-time features
- Consider Redis for production queue management
